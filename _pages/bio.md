## Biography

I was born and raised near **Milan, Italy**, in a family of four: my dad, Stefano, my mom, Cinzia, and my younger brother, Ludovico. After completing *Liceo Scientifico delle Scienze Applicat*e (the Italian equivalent of high school), I decided to pursue a new adventure far from home—college in the United States. I spent my freshman year in West Virginia at **WVU Tech**, and from my sophomore year onward, I moved to Arizona to continue my studies at **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University**.

Making the decision to move so far from home wasn’t easy. Leaving behind the comfort of my family, friends, and everything familiar was a big challenge. However, I chose to move to the USA because of the **incredible opportunities** the country offers. For instance, gaining *hands-on industry experience* through summer internships or *undergraduate research* is much more accessible here compared to Italy. Additionally, I was fortunate to be recruited by several colleges to play soccer, which allowed me to pursue my academic goals while continuing my passion for the sport.

Since childhood, **soccer** has been my greatest passion. I was fortunate to be selected to play at the youth professional level for *Pro Sesto 1919*, making my dream a reality. After competing in the Primavera (the Italian U19 Professional Championship), I had the privilege of playing for *SC Caronnese* and *ASCD Gozzano* in Serie D (the Italian fourth division). My passion for soccer continued throughout my undergraduate studies in the U.S., where I had the honor of playing for the *Golden Bears* of WVU Tech, with whom I won the River States Conference regular season in 2022, and for the *Eagles* of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

Playing soccer has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, time management, and competition, and it has also helped me forge lifelong friendships.

I am a dedicated supporter of **Juventus**, and my favorite player is **Cristiano Ronaldo**—the GOAT.

<span style="color:red"> *Why did you decide to study Data Science?* </span>

During high school, I developed a strong passion for Mathematics, Computer Science, and problem-solving. When I transitioned to college, I chose to study Data Science because of my fascination with how data can be harnessed to address **real-world challenges** and uncover insights that guide **decision-making**. My *dad* played a key role in this decision; recognizing my strengths and interests, he encouraged me to pursue a field that blends analytical thinking, programming, and creativity. I’ve always been intrigued by patterns, trends, and the underlying mechanics of systems, and Data Science provides the perfect platform to explore these curiosities on a much larger scale. Furthermore, the growing demand for data-driven solutions across industries makes Data Science not only a dynamic field but also one with *significant potential for impact*.

<span style="color:red"> *What are your plans after graduation?* </span>

After graduation, I plan to further expand my knowledge in this field by pursuing a **Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence**. I am particularly interested in contributing to the growth of AI, especially in its application to *safety-critical systems*. My primary focus is on **autonomous systems in aviation and aerospace**, where AI can play a crucial role in enhancing safety and reliability.
