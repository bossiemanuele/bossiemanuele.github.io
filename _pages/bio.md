I was born and raised near **Milan, Italy**, in a family of four: my dad, Stefano, my mom, Cinzia, and my younger brother, Ludovico. After completing *Liceo Scientifico delle Scienze Applicat*e (the Italian equivalent of high school), I decided to pursue a new adventure far from home—college in the United States. I spent my freshman year in West Virginia at **WVU Tech**, and from my sophomore year onward, I moved to Arizona to continue my studies at **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University**.

*Why did you decide to move to The USA?*

*What are your hobbies?*

Since childhood, **soccer** has been my greatest passion. I was fortunate to be selected to play at the youth professional level for *Pro Sesto 1919*, making my dream a reality. After competing in the Primavera (the Italian U19 Professional Championship), I had the privilege of playing for *SC Caronnese* and *ASCD Gozzano* in Serie D (the Italian fourth division). My passion for soccer continued throughout my undergraduate studies in the U.S., where I had the honor of playing for the *Golden Bears* of WVU Tech, with whom I won the River States Conference regular season in 2022, and for the *Eagles* of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

Playing soccer has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, time management, and competition, and it has also helped me forge lifelong friendships.

I am a dedicated supporter of **Juventus**, and my favorite player is **Cristiano Ronaldo**—the GOAT.
