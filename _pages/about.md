I am an Undergraduate student at **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University** in the *College of Engineering* and *College of Arts & Sciences*. I am double-major in **Data Science** and **Software Engineering**, with a minor in **Mathematics**. I am a **Teaching Assistant** for Professor *Timothy King* for the 300-level course *Software Engineering Practices* and for the 400-level course *Operating Systems*, for Professor *Christopher Warner* for the 400-level course *Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics*, and for Professor *Andri M. Gretarsson* for the 200-level course *Physics Laboratory for Engineers*. Additionally, I am an **Undergraduate Researcher** in the *Undergraduate Research Institute*, working with different professors across projects that span Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer Science. Particularly, my research is closely conducted under the mentorship of *Dr. Abd Rasheed AlMomani*, Assistant Professor of Data Science and Mathematics and Data Science Program Coordinator. Currently (Summer 2025), I am joining as *Visiting Research Fellow* the **Jain Research Lab** at **Purdue University**. I am working on the project *["Donâ€™t Bother The Driver: Sensor-Scheduling for Cognitive State Estimation During Automated Driving"](https://bossiemanuele.github.io/portfolio/02_SURF/)*.

My **research interests** center on developing trustworthy *autonomous systems* that can operate reliably in high-stakes scenarios, ensuring both safety and efficiency. By integrating principles from optimization, control theory, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and applied linear algebra, I aim to design autonomous agents capable of making robust, real-time decisions in dynamic environments. Specifically, I am particularly interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Transportation and Aerospace.
