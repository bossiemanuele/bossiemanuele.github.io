I am an Undergraduate student at **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University** in the *College of Engineering* and *College of Arts & Sciences*. I am double-major in **Data Science** and **Software Engineering**, with a minor in **Mathematics**. I am a **Teaching Assistant** for Professor *Timothy King* for the 300-level course *Software Engineering Practices* and for Professor *Christopher Warner* for the 400-level course *Machine Learning and Big Data Analysis*. Additionally, I am an **Undergraduate Researcher** in the *Undergraduate Research Institute*, working with different professors across projects that span Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer Science. During Summer 2025, I will join the **Jain Research Lab** at **Purdue University** as recipient of the *Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship*. I will work on the project *"Don't Bother the Driver: Sensor-Scheduling for Cognitive State Estimation During Automated Driving."*

My **research interests** center on developing trustworthy *autonomous systems* that can operate reliably in high-stakes scenarios, ensuring both safety and efficiency. By integrating principles from artificial intelligence, control theory, and human-robot interaction, I aim to design autonomous agents capable of making robust, real-time decisions in dynamic environments. I am particularly interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Aviation and Aerospace.

Upon graduation, I would like to pursue a **Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence**. My **long-term goal** is to push the boundaries of intelligent systems, enabling them to automate increasingly complex tasks in safety-critical applications. I aspire to develop theoretically sound and computationally efficient algorithms that not only enhance autonomy but also ensure practical feasibility for real-world deployment. Through my Ph.D. research, I seek to contribute to the next generation of autonomous systems, ensuring they are not only intelligent but also safe, interpretable, and reliable in the field.
