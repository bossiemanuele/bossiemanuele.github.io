I am an Undergraduate student at **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University** in the *College of Engineering* and *College of Arts & Sciences*. I am dual major in **Data Science** and **Software Engineering**, with a minor in **Mathematics**. I am a [**Teaching Assistant**](https://bossiemanuele.github.io/teaching/) for Professor *Timothy King*, Professor *Christopher Warner*, and Professor *Andri M. Gretarsson*. Additionally, I am an **Undergraduate Researcher** in the *Undergraduate Research Institute*, working with different professors across projects that span Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer Science. Particularly, my research is closely conducted under the mentorship of *Dr. Abd AlRahman AlMomani*, Assistant Professor of Data Science and Mathematics and Data Science Program Coordinator. Currently (Summer 2025), I am joining as *Visiting Research Fellow* the [**Jain Research Lab**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/JainResearchLab/) at **Purdue University**. I am working on the project *["Donâ€™t Bother The Driver: Sensor-Scheduling for Cognitive State Estimation During Automated Driving"](https://bossiemanuele.github.io/portfolio/00_SURF/)*.

My **research interests** center on developing trustworthy *autonomous systems* that can operate reliably in high-stakes scenarios, ensuring both safety and efficiency. By integrating principles from optimization, control theory, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and applied linear algebra, I aim to design autonomous agents capable of making robust, real-time decisions in dynamic environments. Specifically, I am particularly interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Transportation and Aerospace.
