Each year, the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University organizes the **Invent for the Planet (IFTP) Engineering Challenge**,
a 48-hours event where students from around the globe collaborate across disciplines to develop innovative solutions to some of the
world’s most pressing issues. The project featured on this page represents the solution our team developed for *IFTP 2025*.

After winning the university-level competition at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, we were honored to be selected as one of the
7 **global finalists**. Alongside the host team from Texas A&M, we are the *only team from the United States* to advance to the final competition.
Our team, **Agri-AI**, will compete next April at Texas A&M against:

* Team Aquarentures from Al Hussein Technical University (*Jordan*)
* Team Carbon Catch from Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers (*France*)
* Team DeepBlue from Hamad Bin Khalifa University (*Qatar*)
* Team Gaia from Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica and Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (*Brazil*)
* Team HydroShield from Texas A&M University – College Station (*USA*)
* Team Iris from Atlantic Technological University (*Ireland*)
