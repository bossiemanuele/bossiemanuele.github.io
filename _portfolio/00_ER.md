## Abstract

Complex networks are at the heart of natural and engineered systems, where collective behavior emerges from local interactions among interconnected components. Examples include synchronization in power grids, neural connectivity in the brain, epidemic spreading in populations, and cooperative dynamics in multi-agent systems. A central problem in the study of such systems is to recover both the governing dynamics of individual nodes and the underlying network topology that encodes their interactions.

Recovering both the dynamics of individual nodes and the topology of their interactions is a fundamental challenge in the study of complex systems. When the governing rules that link node behavior to network structure are unknown or only partially specified, one loses the predictive and explanatory power that comes from a cohesive model of the system. Real‑world networked systems–––whether in neuroscience, ecology, infrastructure or social science–––typically exhibit strongly coupled behavior: components influence each other via pathways that may be time‑varying, latent, or mediated by hidden variables. For example, in studies of brain networks the structural substrate constrains functional connectivity dynamics, yet transient coordination often arises via polysynaptic pathways beyond direct links. Likewise, in epidemiological contexts such as the COVID‑19 pandemic, transmission is driven not only by clearly documented direct contacts but also by indirect and environmental pathways.

In such settings, knowing just the network structure (who is connected to whom) without the underlying dynamical laws yields limited insight; conversely, modeling node dynamics in isolation without the correct structure may mis‐attribute causal influences or fail to account for emergent phenomena. In this way, a dual recovery framework elevates our ability not only to observe patterns, but to explain, forecast and control complex system behavior.

In this research project, we focus on the introduction of an entropic framework for complex network structure recovery that unifies two key capabilities:

1. Discovery of underlying dynamics: Using Entropic Regression, the framework can identify the governing equations of the individual nodes from observed data, even when their analytical forms are unknown.
2. Network structure recovery: Once the intrinsic dynamics are characterized, ER is used to reveal the coupling topology and relative connection strengths among nodes.

A brief (and still in progress) representation of the framework is available below.
