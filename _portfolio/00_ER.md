## Abstract

System Identification (SID) is the process of reconstructing governing equations and interactions of dynamical systems directly from measured data. Over the past decade, significant advances in sparse regression methods such as SINDy, LASSO, and RIDGE regression have enabled interpretable model discovery while balancing accuracy and complexity. Although deep learning approaches have also been applied to system identification, they often produce black-box models that lack interpretability, require large datasets, and may fail to capture rare or extreme events. Regression-based methods remain critical because they offer parsimonious models, mathematical transparency, and the ability to reveal governing physical mechanisms–––qualities that are essential for advancing scientific understanding and ensuring trust in safety-critical applications.

Entropic Regression (2020) is a recent breakthrough in regression-based system identification. By using information-theoretic principles to guide model selection, it outperforms classical methods in handling nonlinearities, outliers, and stochasticity in time-series data. To date, Entropic Regression has been successfully applied to reconstruct single dynamical systems. However, many real-world phenomena are not isolated but instead consist of coupled networks of interacting dynamical systems, such as interconnected climate subsystems, pandemic spreading models, and interacting flight control systems.

This project proposes the first generalized Entropic Regression algorithm for networks of coupled dynamical systems. The algorithm will be developed to recover both the dynamics of individual nodes and the structure of their interconnections. The outcome will be a robust, interpretable, and scalable framework for network reconstruction under uncertainty.

Potential applications are broad and impactful. In earth sciences, the method could improve climate models by uncovering hidden dependencies across atmospheric or oceanic subsystems. In epidemiology, it could reconstruct transmission networks to better forecast outbreaks. In aviation and aerospace, it could enhance fault detection and resilience by uncovering hidden couplings among aircraft subsystems, allowing early identification of anomalies before they escalate into safety-critical failures.
