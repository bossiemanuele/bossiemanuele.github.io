title: "An Entropy-Based Approach to Measure Quality of Clusters"
excerpt: "This project develops an entropy-based framework for evaluating clustering quality, integrating both geometric structure and local density. Leveraging the Boltzmann–Shannon Interaction Entropy (BSIE), it provides a flexible, generalizable metric suitable for complex, non-spherical, and uneven clusters, enabling robust assessment of data partitions across diverse feature spaces."
