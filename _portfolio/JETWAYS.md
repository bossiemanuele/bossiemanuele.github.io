This project has been funded by **Boeing**.
The advisors for this project are **Dr. Yimga**, Department Chair of School of Business and Associate Professor,
and **Dr. Bryner**, Department Chair and Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
This project is conducted in collaboration with other 4 undergraduate students.

## Abstract

The first stage of this project aims to understand the current status of jetways and explore the feasibility of developing
an automated jetway to enhance the efficiency and safety of boarding and deboarding processes.
Considerations include the following business and engineering aspects:
How can airframe differences be addressed, what changes are needed to allow for automation (sensors, integration, structure, power systems),
who are the main players/stakeholders, what is the expected cost, what would an implementation process look like.
