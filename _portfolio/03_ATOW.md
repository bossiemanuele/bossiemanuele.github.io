title: "Uncovering Direct Influence Networks of Takeoff Weight"
excerpt: "This research develops an interpretable machine learning framework to estimate aircraft Actual Takeoff Weight (ATOW) using flight metadata and ADS-B data, supported by feature analysis and error correction. The approach improves accuracy, robustness, and transparency over existing methods, enabling safer and more efficient aviation operations."
