This project has been funded by **ERAU CBSI Philanthropy Council** for the AY 2024-2025. The advisors for this project are **Prof. King**, Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical, Computer & Software Engineering, and **Prof. McIntire**, Department Chair and Assistant Professor of Aeronautical Science. This project is conducted in collaboration with Francesco Busini, undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering.

## Abstract

As Artificial Intelligence increasingly supports critical decision-making in different real-world contexts, understanding trust between humans and AI becomes crucial. The goal of this study is to explore how various levels of AI transparency, control, and error influence human trust in AI-based decision support in safety-critical systems. ​By evaluating participant responses to AI recommendations across different operational modes, this research aims to identify optimal conditions that foster trust and enhance collaboration between humans and AI in high-risk environments​. The findings will inform the development of more effective and reliable AI systems​.

### Experiment Design

We presented our experiment design draft at the NASA Space Grant Symposium in Scottsdale (AZ) in April, 2025. We will shortly update this page with the recording of the speech.
