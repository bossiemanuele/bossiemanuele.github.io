This research project will be conducted during Summer 2025 at **Jain Research Lab**, the research laboratory of Dr. Jain at **Purdue University**.
The advisors for this project are **Dr. Jain**, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering (by courtesy in Aeronautics & Astronautics), and
**S. Jeevanandam**, Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering.
This project is part of the **2025 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)** program at Purdue University.

As part of the program, I will present my research at the **Purdue University Summer Symposium** on July 30, 2025.

## Project Description

The following is the project description as per SURF Research Projects catalog. A more accurate abstract will be uploaded
during or after the completition of the research project.

"During safety-critical human-automation interactions such as automated driving,
knowledge of cognitive states such as the driver’s trust in the automation can help prevent automation misuse (over-reliance).
However, unlike estimating the speed of a car, estimating a human’s cognitive state is not straightforward;
it needs to be inferred from their behavior (usage of automation, eye-gaze), involuntary physiological responses (heart-rate),
and what they self-report (to questions like “How much do you trust the automation?”).
Unlike recording data-streams from sensors such as a heart-rate monitor, it is not reasonable to ask the user
to report their trust too frequently. The goal of this project is to enable development and testing of algorithms that
schedule solicitation of self-reports only when absolutely required to reduce uncertainty in cognitive state estimates.

The student will gain experience in:

- **Driving simulation for human-centric research**
- **Conducting human subject experiments**
- **State estimation algorithms**"

## Research Area

As part of the Jain Research Lab, this project is focused on the **Human-Automation Interaction** research area of the lab.
The following is the description of the research area from the official website of the research lab.

"Across all aspects of our lives, humans are being asked to interact, collaborate, and team with different types of autonomous systems.
At the core of successful cooperation between human and machine is trust. To that end, we are interested in mathematically modeling
how human trust, and other human cognitive states (mental workload, self-confidence, risk perception), evolve during their interactions with
machines and how feedback control principles can be applied to achieve the promise of automation—improving human quality of life.
We have published several articles in this area, including on

* **novel machine learning-based approaches** for estimating human trust via physiological (galvanic skin response (GSR) and electroencephalography (EEG) as well as behavioral measures;
* **Markov-based modeling** of human trust and workload during human interactions with recommender (decision aid) systems that we in turn use for adaptive user interface (UI) design;
* **cognitively-aware intelligent tutoring/training systems (ITSs)** that leverage self-confidence feedback from the human, and models of how user performance affects self-confidence, to determine when to provide automation assistance to users learning a psychomotor task.

We are also studying how human operators make decisions in process manufacturing and using machine learning techniques 
to assess how automation, combined with operator expertise, can achieve better, and more consistent performance."
